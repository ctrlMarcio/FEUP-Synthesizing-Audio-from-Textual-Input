    \frametitle{Introduction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sound generation is the task of creating realistic and expressive sounds from scratch or based on some input
        \item It has many applications in music, entertainment, education, and research
        \item There are different types of sound generation methods, depending on the level of abstraction and supervision involved
        \item Four types of sound generation methods are considered in this thesis:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Traditional
            \item Unsupervised
            \item Vocoders
            \item End-to-end models
        \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Traditional Soundscape Generation}
    
    \textbf{Approach}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Threefold strategy: Segmentation, Feature extraction, Resynthesis
        \item Statistical models and stochastic processes used
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Notable Tools}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Scaper}~\cite{salamon_scaper_2017}: Open-source library for synthetic sound environments
        \item SEED~\cite{bernardes_seed_2016}: System for resynthesizing environmental sounds with precise control over variation
        \item Physics-Based Concatenative Sound Synthesis~\cite{magalhaes_physics-based_2020}: Creates novel auditory experiences by assembling pre-existing sound segments
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Unsupervised Sound Generation}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Unsupervised Sound Generation}
    
    \textbf{Approach}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Learn sound features and distributions without explicit labels
        \item Utilize unlabeled audio data for pattern capture and structure learning
        \item Valuable when labeled datasets are limited or costly
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Notable Models}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item WaveGAN~\cite{donahue_adversarial_2019}: Unsupervised waveform synthesis using modified GAN
        \item Generative Transformer~\cite{verma_generative_2021}: Autoregressive prediction of audio samples using transformer networks
        \item wav2vec 2.0~\cite{baevski_wav2vec_2020}: Speech generation model with convolutional feature encoder, Transformer, and quantization module
        \item SoundStream~\cite{zeghidour_soundstream_2021}: Neural audio codec for efficient audio compression
