\section{Datasets} \label{sec:prob-datasets}

For the proposed problem, ideal datasets would have entries of sound samples under multiple conditions with labels written in a \ac{NLP} form.

With multiple conditions, one may think, for instance, of multiple sounds of a dog barking. An ideal dataset would have a dog barking in different places, under different atmospheric conditions, and with other possible variants. For example, this ideal dataset would have ``A dog barking in a city'', ``A dog barking in the countryside where it is raining'', and others.

Multiple sounds over or followed by each other would exist in the ideal dataset. For example, ``A dog barking followed by a truck honking'' or ``A traffic jam while a woman sings'' would be examples of the entries in the perfect dataset.

The perfect dataset would also have characteristics of the sounds themselves. For instance, not only ``A dog barking'', but rather ``A dog barking aggressively'', or ``A dog barking with joy'' would be examples of entries in the perfect dataset.

These datasets do not exist in the real world. Thus, some measures must be taken. This discussion is proposed in Section~\ref{sec:sol-datasets}.
