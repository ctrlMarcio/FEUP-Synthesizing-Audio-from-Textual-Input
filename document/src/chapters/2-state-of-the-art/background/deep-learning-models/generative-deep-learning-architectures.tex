\subsubsection{Generative Deep Learning Architectures}

Generative \ac{DL} architectures are a subset of \ac{DL} networks designed to generate new and diverse data samples from a learned distribution.

By finding latent data structures and learning to reproduce the hidden statistics behind observed data, they do so. To achieve this, the model tries to estimate an underlying probability distribution $p_{data}$ when given a set of samples from this distribution. Thus, training a generative model involves selecting the best parameters that reduce some concept of distance/loss/error between the model and the actual distribution. As Huzaifah \cite{huzaifah_deep_2021} states: ``given training data points $X$ as samples from an empirical distribution $p_{data}(X)$, we want to learn a model $p_\theta(X)$, belonging to a model family $M$ that closely matches $p_{data}(X)$, by repeatedly changing model parameters $\theta$''. This is expressed as the problem in equation \ref{eq:generative-models-base}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:generative-models-base}
    \min_{\theta \in M} d (p_{data}, p_\theta)
\end{equation}

Standard functions for $d$ are displayed in section \ref{sec:loss-functions}.

These models have been applied to various tasks, such as image synthesis, text generation, and audio synthesis. Generative \ac{DL} models have gained popularity recently due to their ability to produce high-quality data and model complex distributions.

This section will present the most used architectures.
