\subsubsection{Data Augmentation} \label{sec:data-augmentation}

Data augmentation is crucial to \ac{ML} tasks. It helps to increase the training dataset's size and improve the model's robustness. For the task at hand, there are two main types of data augmentation: acoustic and linguistic. Data augmentation can reduce overfitting and improve generalization by introducing more variations into the training set~\cite{pluscec_data_2023}.
