# Synthesizing Audio from Textual Input

## Overview

The project titled "Synthesizing Audio from Textual Input: Development and Comparison of Generative AI Models" aims to create realistic audio samples from textual inputs using different generative models. The project contains the LaTeX and Python code that the author used to develop their master thesis. The project compares several models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), and proposes a novel model called GANmix. GANmix uses a GAN to generate embeddings in the latent space of a pretrained VAE, and then uses the VAE decoder to reconstruct the audio samples from the embeddings. The project evaluates the performance of GANmix and other models on various metrics.

## Goals

- To demonstrate the development and implementation of different generative models for synthesizing audio from textual inputs
- To showcase the original contribution of GANmix, a novel model that combines a GAN and a VAE to generate high-quality and diverse audio samples
- To present the results and analysis of the experiments conducted on various datasets and metrics
- To discuss the challenges, limitations, and future directions of the project
